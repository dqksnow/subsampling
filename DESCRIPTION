Description: 
    Subsampling methods are utilized in statistical modeling for
    massive datasets. These methods aim to draw representative subsamples from the
    full dataset based on specific sampling probabilities, with the goal of
    maintaining inference efficiency. The sampling probabilities are tailored to
    particular objectives, such as minimizing the variance of the estimated
    coefficients or reducing prediction error. By using subsampling techniques, the
    package balances the trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical
    efficiency, making it a practical tool for massive data analysis.
