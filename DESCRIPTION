Description: 
    Balancing computational and statistical efficiency, subsampling techniques offer
    a practical solution for handling large-scale data analysis. Subsampling methods
    enhance statistical modeling for massive datasets by efficiently drawing
    representative subsamples from full dataset based on tailored sampling probabilities. These
    probabilities are optimized for specific goals, such as minimizing the variance
    of coefficient estimates or reducing prediction error. Based on specified 
    modeling assumptions and subsampling techniques, the package provides 
    functions to draw subsamples from the full data, fit the model on the 
    subsamples, and perform statistical inference.
