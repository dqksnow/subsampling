Description: 
    Balancing computational and statistical efficiency, subsampling techniques offer
    a practical solution for handling large-scale data analysis. Subsampling methods
    enhance statistical modeling for massive datasets by efficiently drawing
    representative subsamples from full dataset based on tailored sampling probabilities. These
    probabilities are optimized for specific goals, such as minimizing the variance
    of coefficient estimates or reducing prediction error.
